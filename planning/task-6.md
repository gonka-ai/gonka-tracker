# Task 6: Participant Details Modal with Consensus Key and URL

## Task
Create interactive participant details modal accessible by clicking table rows, displaying comprehensive information including validator consensus key and inference URL, with reordered table columns for improved usability.

## Status
COMPLETED

## Result
Production-ready modal interface with:
- Clickable participant rows in table
- Centered modal overlay with detailed participant information
- Validator consensus key (validator_key) and inference URL display
- Comprehensive statistics view with visual highlighting
- Reordered table columns (Jail and Health moved to right side)
- Keyboard and click-outside modal controls
- All 52 backend tests passing, frontend builds successfully

## Actual Structure

    └── ParticipantTable.tsx     # Clickable rows, reordered columns
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Backend Data Model Extension

**Extended ParticipantStats model:**
- Added `validator_key: Optional[str] = None` field
- Field extracted from epoch participant data
- Preserved in both current and historical epoch queries

**Updated service layer (two locations):**
1. `get_current_epoch_stats()` - current epoch data
2. `get_historical_epoch_stats()` - historical epoch data

Both locations now include validator_key in epoch_participant_data dictionary and pass it to ParticipantStats instantiation.

### Phase 2: Frontend Type Definitions

**Extended Participant interface:**
- Added `validator_key?: string` field
- Maintains type safety across components
- Optional to handle cases where data unavailable

### Phase 3: Modal Component Creation

**ParticipantModal component features:**
- Centered overlay with semi-transparent backdrop
- White card with shadow and rounded corners
- Scrollable content for long participant data

**Modal sections:**
1. **Basic Information:**
   - Participant Address (merged index/address as they're identical)
   - Consensus Key (validator_key, monospace font)
   - URL (inference_url as clickable link)
   - Weight, Jail Status, Health Status (horizontal layout)
   - Models (gray badges with proper wrapping)

2. **Inference Statistics (6-grid layout):**
   - Total Inferenced
   - Missed Requests (red if > 0)
   - Validated Inferences
   - Invalidated Inferences (red if > 0)
   - Missed Rate (red if > 10%)
   - Invalidation Rate (red if > 10%)

**Modal controls:**
- X button in top-right corner
- Click backdrop to close
- Press Escape key to close
- Event listener cleanup on unmount

### Phase 4: Table Integration and Column Reordering

**Updated ParticipantTable component:**
- Added state management: `selectedParticipant` state
- Added click handlers: `handleRowClick()` and `handleCloseModal()`
- Made rows clickable: added `cursor-pointer` class
- Integrated modal: renders `ParticipantModal` component

**Column reorder (addresses horizontal scrolling issue):**

Previous order (required scrolling):
1. Participant Index, 2. Jail, 3. Health, 4. Weight...

New order (no scrolling needed):
1. Participant Index
2. Weight
3. Models
4. Total Inferenced
5. Missed Requests
6. Validated Inferences
7. Invalidated Inferences
8. Missed Rate %
9. Invalidation Rate %
10. Jail (moved from position 2)
11. Health (moved from position 3)

**Rationale:** Jail and Health are informative but less critical than inference statistics. Moving them right eliminates horizontal scroll for primary data.

### Phase 5: Visual Design Consistency

**Color logic (consistent with table):**
- Missed Requests count: red when > 0, gray otherwise
- Invalidated Inferences count: red when > 0, gray otherwise
- Missed Rate percentage: red when > 10%, gray otherwise
- Invalidation Rate percentage: red when > 10%, gray otherwise

**Design principles:**
- Minimalistic gray/black color palette
- No emoji or unnecessary decoration
- Monospace font for technical values (addresses, keys)
- Clear section separation with borders
- Professional typography and spacing

## Key Implementation Details

### Data Flow

**Backend → Frontend:**
1. Epoch participant data fetched from Gonka Chain
2. validator_key extracted and included in response
3. Frontend receives complete participant data
4. Modal displays all available fields

**No additional API calls required:**
- All data already fetched for table display
- Modal simply presents existing data in detailed view
- Efficient single-request architecture

### User Experience

**Table interaction:**
- Entire row clickable (clear affordance with cursor-pointer)
- Hover effect indicates interactivity
- Red highlighting preserved for problem participants
- Click opens modal immediately

**Modal interaction:**
- Centered overlay prevents interaction with table
- Multiple close methods (X, Escape, backdrop click)
- Scrollable for participants with many models
- Responsive to different screen sizes

### Technical Considerations

**State management:**
- Modal state local to ParticipantTable component
- No global state pollution
- Clean mounting/unmounting with proper cleanup

**Event handling:**
- Escape key listener added/removed with modal state
- Click event propagation stopped on modal content
- Prevents unintended interactions

**Performance:**
- No re-fetching on modal open
- Uses existing participant data from table
- Lightweight component with minimal overhead

## Testing

### Backend Testing
- All 52 tests passing
- validator_key field properly serialized
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Data extraction works for both current and historical epochs

### Frontend Testing
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No linting errors
- Build successful (159.23 kB gzipped)
- Manual testing:
  - Modal opens on row click
  - All data displays correctly
  - Close mechanisms work (X, Escape, backdrop)
  - Scrolling works for long content
  - Responsive behavior verified

### Integration Testing
- validator_key appears in API responses
- inference_url renders as clickable link
- Color logic matches table exactly
- Table column reorder eliminates horizontal scroll

## Configuration

No new environment variables or configuration required. Uses existing:
- `INFERENCE_URLS` - Gonka Chain API endpoints
- `CACHE_DB_PATH` - SQLite database path

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Jail and Health columns in positions 2-3 required horizontal scroll
- No way to view detailed participant information
- validator_key and inference_url not visible

### After
- Core statistics visible without scrolling
- Jail and Health accessible on right side
- Click any participant for comprehensive details
- Consensus key and URL prominently displayed
- Better information hierarchy

## Future Enhancements

The modal structure enables:
- Historical inference trends per participant
- Jail history timeline visualization
- Health check history graphs
- ML node details and PoC weights
- Direct inference testing interface
